# xG-Model_Machine-Learning-Project
This repository was created following the conclusion of a group project about expected goals in world football for Babson College's course on machine learning.

The original data was acquired from Luca Pappalardo and Emanuele Massucco's original research published to figshare.com.

Data_Preprocessing.R includes all of the code used to clean and process the original dataset. The conclusion of this particular R script results in a saved .csv file titled myData.csv which is included in this repositiory. The myData.csv file was used for all further analysis and model building. 

Following the data cleaning and preprocessing conducted in Data_Preprocessing.R, exploratory analsysis was conducted in Exploratory_Analysis.R. While observing our data using both tabular and graphical means, we were able to come away with a number of important insights prior to the model building process.

An XG Boost model was built in XGBoost_Xg_model.R file.

An extensive written report from the group is included in the pdf file Written_Report.pdf
